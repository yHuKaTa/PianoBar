# PianoBar
This is my first GUI project! C'mon test it :)

The application provides the user with an intuitive graphical environment for the operation of a POS system in a night club or bar.
The interface is in Bulgarian.

There is a division of the products offered by categories and subcategories. In the order, the offered quantity can be changed, an order can be deleted, the corresponding order can be paid, etc., as it happens in a real environment.

There are separate functionalities for waiter, manager and bar owner. Accordingly, the waiter can fulfill orders for the customers, the manager can adjust the quantities and carry out the delivery of the necessary products, and the owner can do absolutely everything, even adding, modifying and removing users in the application.


The starting point in the application is entering the PIN of the respective user.
Examples are the following users:

Waiter: 0000 or 0202

Manager: 0101

Owner: 2525

The order generation logic is to select a table number to start with. In this case, from 1 to 20. Select the relevant products, bearing in mind that each subsequent press of the same button will increase the quantity of the desired product.

The app user can close the customer's order by noting the payment method and if it's cash, the app can calculate the change. If it is by bank transfer or card, there is no change and the corresponding field is not necessary.

You can view the rest of the functions in the application itself. I have made the application very intuitive, so that it has the simplest logic and consistency in operation. Take a few minutes to review the PianoBar app.
